        <p>Iron Man is a superhero appearing in <em style="background-color:#1a89171a ;"> American comic books </em>
            published by Marvel Comics. The character was co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by
            scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby. The character made his first
            appearance in Tales of Suspense #39 (cover dated March 1963), and received his own title in Iron Man #1 (May
            1968). In 1963, the character founded the Avengers superhero team with Thor, Ant-Man, Wasp and the Hulk.
            <br> <br>

            A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, philanthropist, inventor and ingenious scientist, Anthony
            Edward "Tony" Stark suffers a severe chest injury during a kidnapping. When his captors attempt to force him
            to build a weapon of mass destruction, he instead creates a mechanized suit of armor to save his life and
            escape captivity. Later, Stark develops his suit, adding weapons and other technological devices he designed
            through his company, Stark Industries. He uses the suit and successive versions to protect the world as Iron
            Man. Although at first concealing his true identity, Stark eventually publicly reveals himself to be Iron
            Man. <br> <br>

            Initially, Stan Lee used Iron Man to explore Cold War themes, particularly the role of American technology
            and industry in the fight against communism. Subsequent re-imaginings of Iron Man have shifted to
            contemporary matters. <br> <br>

            Iron Man has headlined various comic book series. Throughout most of the character's publication history, he
            has been a founding member of the Avengers. <br> <br>

            Iron Man has been adapted for several animated television shows and films. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe,
            Tony Stark was portrayed by Robert Downey Jr. in the films Iron Man (2008), The Incredible Hulk (2008), Iron
            Man 2 (2010), The Avengers (2012), Iron Man 3 (2013), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Captain America: Civil
            War (2016), Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019);
            while Mick Wingert voiced the character in the animated series What If...? (2021).</p>

            <em style="background-color:#1a89171a ;">Tony Stark's personality is inverted during the events of AXIS,
                bringing out more dark aspects of himself like irresponsibility, egotism and alcoholism</em>. Stark
            relocates to San Francisco and builds a new, all-white armor. He supplies the citizens of San Francisco with
            the Extremis 3.0 app, a version of the techno-virus that offers beauty, health or even immortality, free.
            When every person in the city viewed Iron Man as a messiah for making their dreams come true, he ended the
            free trial mode and started charging a daily fee of $99.99, causing many to resort to crime to pay for the
            upgrade.Daredevil confronts Stark at his new Alcatraz Island penthouse, but is easily brushed off. Iron Man
            uses Extremis 3.0 to temporarily restore Daredevil's sight, just to prove his point. Daredevil deduces that
            Stark had added Extremis to the water supply and the phones only transmit an activation signal, but Stark
            subjects Murdock to minor brain damage to prevent him from sharing this revelation with others. <br> <br>
            After discovering that new villain Teen Abomination is the son of Happy Hogan, Stark decides to help him,
            but this minor act of redemption is too late for Pepper Potts, who attacks Stark with the aid of an AI based
            on Stark's mind. This culminates in a confrontation between the two Starks, as Stark calls on the unwitting
            aid of all 'infected' with the Extremis upgrade while the AI uses Stark's various old armors to attack him.
            Although Stark technically wins the battle as he destroys his other armors and deletes the AI backup, Pepper
            states that she plans to reveal the truth about his goals with Extremis, bluntly informing him that if he
            continues his Extremis upgrade project, he will have to do it alone, accepting his fate of being regarded as
            a monster by all who know him.

        <h2>Why Ironman is best avenger</h2>
        <p>
            <em style="background-color:#1a89171a ;">He created much of the tech and gadgets the Avengers use</em>,
            including the Hulkbuster and Iron Spider suits. <br> He also figured out a little thing called time travel;
            great as they are, neither Thor nor Captain America were ever going to pull that off.
